An interface is introduced into the system by fixing the spins on opposite boundaries in two different states, +1 and -1. They pay particular attention to the appearance of an excess of the third state, 0, in the vicinity of the interface. The net adsorption of the non-boundary state is studied near critical, first-order and tricritical transitions. Two methods have been used to attack this problem, the Monte Carlo technique and a modified version of the interface free energy approximation of Muller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1977) which is seen to give a surprisingly good description of interface properties in three-state systems.}

  abstract={The magnetic properties of a spin-1 Blumeâ€“Capel (BC) model on a square lattice ( q =4) with a ferromagnetic interaction have been examined here by the use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique and an introduced effective-field approximation (IEFT), which includes the correlations between different spins that emerge when expanding the identities. The effects of the external magnetic field and crystal field on the magnetic properties of the spin system are discussed in detail. In order to obtain credible results, a detailed comparison of the results obtained by the two methods has been made with those of the other methods in the literature. A number of interesting phenomena originating from the temperature, crystal field and external field have been found.}

  abstract={The total many-body correlations present in finite temperature classical spin systems are studied using the concept of mutual information. As opposed to zero-temperature quantum phase transitions, the total correlations are not maximal at the phase transition, but reach a maximum in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. The Shannon mutual information and the Renyi mutual information in both Ising and Potts models in two dimensions are calculated numerically by combining matrix product state algorithms and Monte Carlo sampling techniques.}

  abstract={We study the finite-temperature behavior of the Lipkinâ€“Meshkovâ€“Glick model with a focus on correlation properties as measured by the mutual information. The latter, which quantifies the amount of both classical and quantum correlations, is computed exactly in the two limiting cases of vanishing magnetic field and vanishing temperature. For all other situations, numerical results provide evidence of a finite mutual information at all temperatures except at criticality. There, it diverges as the logarithm of the system size, with a prefactor that can take only two values, depending on whether the critical temperature vanishes or not. Our work provides a simple example in which the mutual information appears as a powerful tool to detect finite-temperature phase transitions, contrary to entanglement measures such as the concurrence.}

  abstract={The authors calculate the universal part F of the free energy of rectangular domains at critical points by use of conformal field theory. F includes a term logarithmic in the size (or area), due to the corners. In addition, there is a term F 0 depending on the aspect ratio, which they determine by integrating the stress tensor (T) over the rectangle. This term involves complete elliptic integrals, but may be more simply expressed in terms of the Dedekind eta -function. For central charge c>0, they find that F 0 is maximal for squares, providing a thermodynamic driving force for the elongation of small domains, and argue that this should be a general tendency.}
